# The BrainCode Games

## Description

The BrainCode Games is a hackathon, a collaborative competition whose ultimate goal is to develop a solution to an open problem in a short (but very intense!) period of time. The idea of The BrainCode Games is to use **Articial Intelligence** tools to solve a **Neuroscience** problem. But don't worry if you feel that you lack the required knowledge or skills set. The final objective of this hackathon is that you learn, in a **didactic, practical and fun** way, about some hot topics (artificial intelligence, neuroscience and programming) that are more and more demanded nowadays. For this reason we will organize a series of **lectures** before the event to prepare you for it. You will receive an attendance **certificate** for the total amount of formation and participation hours. And of course, there will be an **economic award** for the teams that get the best results.

### Sign up

If you are interested, sign up using the following **[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRXJrgS9pzjdWVZeb912Bbw3gX4v5m3-ksiC6zEfrSRlm8cQ/viewform)**, and follow us in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BraincodeGames) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/braincodegames/), where we will post important information related to the event and the topics that will be covered. Ah! And don't worry if you don't have a team, we will match you with the person that better complements your skills :P

## More about...

Here we explain more in detail each of the aspects related to the event. If you have any question, don't hesitate in contact us:
**braincodegames@gmail.com**

### ...the open problem

It consists in detecting certain events in electrophysiological signals (which are recordings of the neural system electrical activity). These events, called *sharp wave ripples* or just *ripples*, are a kind of fast oscillations as the ones that are shown in the picture. They appear repeteadly in the activity of a region of our brains, called hippocampus, and are in charge of consolidating memory. Studying these `ripples` takes as closer to understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory and many laboratories around the world focus their research on these events. It has also been proved that interrupting `ripples` prevents memories from getting formed, and that prolonging them improves memory.

The biological signal where we can see the `ripples`, like the one shown in the image, is known as *Local Field Potential* or **LFP**. Neurons are constantly getting and loosing ions and this electric flow is translated into an electric potential that, in addition to all the surrounding neurons potentials, create this electrical signal which can be registered by our measure devices. Therefore, the `LFP` is a signal that represents the overall neural activity of the individual neurons that are around the area where the measurement electrode is placed. In the picture above we can see 8 aligned electrodes recording the `LFP` at different spots of the brain.

`Ripples` take place in the brain area called **hippocampus**, a very primitive part in charge, mainly, of memory and spatial information processing (tasks such as creating a mental map of the world, orientation, etc). Hippocampal neurons are placed in such a way that individual electric potentials are not cancelled between them, but they add to each other, making it easier to see oscillations in the `LFP`.

Pues bien, el objetivo de la hackatón es desarrollar un algoritmo utilizando herramientas de inteligencia artificial y *machine learning* para detectar `ripples` en registros en una serie temporal como es el `LFP` (sampleado a 1250 Hz). Para ello, os proporcionaremos una base de datos con la señal `LFP` y los tiempos de los `ripples`, etiquetados uno a uno manualmente por nuestra experta. De esta manera podréis utilizar la metodología de aprendizaje supervisado, y entrenar un algoritmo para que los detecte.

Well then, the goal of this hackathon is to develop an algorithm, using *artificial intelligence* and *machine learning* techniques, capable of detecting `ripples` in temporal series of neural data as the `LFP` (sampled at 1250 Hz). In order to accomplish this, we will provide you a database with `LFP` recordings and the times of `ripples` detected manually in those signals by our expert. This way you can use any supervised learning approach and train the algorithm to detect the events.

All these topics will be covered in detail later.

### ...the hackathon

Hackathon was originally a term coming from the hacker community and was used to refer to a programmers meeting that had the collaborative development of software as an objective, but nowadays it is used in many other fields. These events usually last between two days and a week. Some of them have educative or social purposes, but in most cases the goal is to create functional software. In our case, the purpose is both to apply AI tools to neuroscience and also to teach these techniques in a didactic way :) 

This term brings together the concepts of marathon and hacker, as a reference to a collective experience with the common goal of developing applications in a collaborative way in a short amount of time.

A hackathon, from the organizative point of view, implies an horizontal and intensive dynamic where all participants complement each others individual experiences and abilities with the goal of reaching a solution. For this reason, if we look at it from the educational side, this kind of event posseses certain properties of a pedagogical device, since it promotes collaborative work among peers aimed to problem solving, it focuses on the working process as an instance of learning and facilitates intrinsic motivation in the participants. 

Hackathon are, moreover, an increasingly common hiring method in business.

### ...the lectures

There will be three lectures about:

- **Artificial Intelligence:** it will explain what is Artificial Intelligence and *Machine Learning*. It will cover various strategies to approach different problems, according to their characteristics, with a special focus on supervised-learning algorithms, since are the ones that better fit our open problem. Conducted by [Daniel García-Rincón](https://es.linkedin.com/in/darcia-dev).

- **Neuroscience:** For the people coming from more technical backgrounds, we will review the mechanisms that our brain has to process information. Starting from its most simple elements, neurons, up to neural circuits and how these are able to codify the world. We will study what neural oscillations are and how they are related to behaviour. Conducted by [Enrique R Sebastian](https://twitter.com/EnrRodSeb).

- **Python:** For those with little programming experience, or with experience in different languages, there will be an introductory course to Python, covering from the most simple and usual syntax to small programs using artificial intelligence tools, like the ones that you may use during the hackathon. Conducted by [Andrea Navas-Olive](https://twitter.com/acnavasolive).

The purpose of all lectures and materials uploaded to this web is to provide you some sort of guide so you can take a deeper look into these topics on your own.

### ...what will I gain from this experience

- You will learn about very demanded topics, both in research and science but also in the business world.

- ... and you will do so in a way that promotes hands-on practice, collaboration and having fun.

- You will work with a multidisciplanary team in order to solved a problem in a short period of time.

- And, possibly, an economic award, since money never hurts ;)
