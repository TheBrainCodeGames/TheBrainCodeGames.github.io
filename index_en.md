# The BrainCode Games

## Description

The BrainCode Games is a hackathon, a kind of collaborative competition, which ultimate goal is to develop a solution to an open problem in a short period of time (but very much intense!). The idea of The BrainCode Games is to use **Artificial Intelligence** to solve a **Neuroscience** problem. Don’t worry if you feel lacking the required knowledge or skills. The final objective of this hackathon is that you learn, in a **didactic, practical and fun** way, about some hot topics of the field (artificial intelligence, neuroscience and programming). For this reason, we will organize a series of **lectures** before the event that you can follow remotely. You will receive an attendance **certificate** for training and participation hours. And there will be **awards** for the team with best results.

## Lectures and material

- **Neuroscience:** For people with more technical backgrounds, we will review the mechanisms that our brain has to process information. Starting from the simplest elements, the neurons, up to neural circuits, and how they build a neural representation of the world. We will study what are neural oscillations and how they are related to behaviour. Conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/EnrRodSeb" target="_blank">Enrique R Sebastian</a>.

## More about...

See below for more information. If you have any question, do not hesitate in contact us:

### ...the open problem

The problem consists in detecting certain events from electrophysiological signals (which are recordings of the brain activity). These events, called *sharp wave ripples* or just *ripples*, are a kind of fast oscillations as those shown in the picture below. They appear repetitively in a region of our brains dubbed hippocampus, which is responsible for consolidating memories. Studying `ripples` is critical for us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of memory and many laboratories around the world focus their research on these events. It has been proved that interrupting `ripples` prevents memories from getting formed, and that prolonging them may improve memory.

![Image of ripple](/assets/images/ejemplo_ripple.png)

The biological signal where we can see `ripples` is known as *Local Field Potential* or **LFP**. This is a kind of local EEG (or electroencephalogram). Neurons are constantly interchanging ions and this electric flow is translated into an electric potential that together with those emanating from surrounding regions, create an electrical signal which can be detected by our measuring devices. Therefore, the `LFP` is a signal that represents the overall neural activity of the many neurons that are around the area where the measurement electrode is placed. In the picture above, we can see 8 aligned electrodes recording the `LFP` at different equally spaced locations of the hippocampus.

`Ripples` are generated in the **hippocampus**, a very primitive brain region with roles in memory and spatial information processing (tasks such as creating a mental map of the world, orientation, etc). Hippocampal neurons are distributed in such a way that individual electric potentials add each other, making easier to see oscillations in the `LFP`.

Well! The goal of this hackathon is to develop an algorithm based on *artificial intelligence* and *machine learning* techniques, capable of detecting `ripples` in time series such as the `LFP` (sampled at 1250 Hz). In order to accomplish this, we will provide you a database with `LFP` recordings and the times of `ripples` manually annotated by our expert. You are free to use any supervised learning approach for addressing the challenge.

All these topics will be covered in detail in a series of lectures.

### ...the hackathon

Hackathon was a term originally coming from the hacker community and used to refer to a meeting of programmers enrolled in a collaborative challenge. These events usually last between two days and a week. Some of them have educative or social purposes, but in most cases the goal is to create functional software. In our case, the purpose is both to apply AI tools to neuroscience and also to teach these techniques in a didactic way :)

This term lumps together the concepts of marathon and hacker, as a reference to a collective experience with the common goal of developing applications in a collaborative way in a short amount of time. From an educational perspective, this kind of event represents a pedagogical tool, since it promotes collaborative work among peers aimed to problem solving; it focuses on the working process as an instance of learning and facilitates intrinsic motivation in participants.

Hackathons are, moreover, an increasingly common hiring method in business.


### ...what will I gain from this experience

- You will learn about hot topics, both in research and the business world.

- ... and you will do so in a way that promotes hands-on practice, collaboration and fun.

- You will work with a multidisciplinary team in order to solved a problem in a short period of time.

- And, possibly, you will earn an award. Money can’t hurt you ;)
